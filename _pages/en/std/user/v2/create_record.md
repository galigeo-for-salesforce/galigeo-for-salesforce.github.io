# Objects Creation

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"> <strong>Important :</strong> The record creation feature is only available in the Salesforce Lightning Context and the Salesforce Mobile App.</div>

## From the Map

From the current position, symbolized by the green pin on the map ![Data Explorer]({{ site.url }}/assets/img-std-v2/user/icons/icon_currentlocation.png), it is possible to launch the new object creation form in CRM. The list presented by opening the "Create a Record" menu corresponds to the opened layers configurations.

In the below example, four layers are opened:

- PDV IDF: Configuration on a POS object (custom object)
- FR Accounts: Configuration on the Account object
- Distributors: Configuration on the Distributor object (custom object)
- Pharmas: Configuration on the Pharmacy object (custom object)

![Create Record]({{ site.url }}/assets/img-std-v2-en/user/createrecords/newrecord_list.png){:.img.img-responsive.img-center.img-bordered}

By clicking on one of the options presented, the creation form opens, in which the address and location information are pre-filled.

![Create Record]({{ site.url }}/assets/img-std-v2-en/user/createrecords/newcustomrecord.png){:.img.img-responsive.img-center.img-bordered}
