# Visualize and localize your Salesforce Data in a few clicks

The new version allows you to view simultaneously on the same map all your localizable Salesforce data such as your accounts, customers, prospects, distributors, sites, partners ...

With one click, you can view all the information linked to an "object", for example all the contacts of a customer account.

You can thus combine thousands of standard or custom objects, with the guarantee of performance, simplicity and access security.

- Sort by column
- Filter by keyword on the name
- Filtering by column according to multiple configurable conditions (date of last visit, status, turnover range, etc.)
