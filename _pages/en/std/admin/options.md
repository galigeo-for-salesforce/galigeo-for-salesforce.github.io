# Options

## Event duration

After a route calculation it is possible to insert events based on their duration. By default, the time duration is 60 minutes but this value can be configured in the « Option » tab of the Galigeo Administration page.

![Galigeo for Salesforce Admin]({{ site.url }}/assets/img-std-admin-en/options-event_duration.png){:.img.img-responsive.img-center.img-bordered}

This event duration is then used to calculate the events’ slots. 

![Galigeo for Salesforce Admin]({{ site.url }}/assets/img-std-admin-en/options-event_duration_add_cal.png){:.img.img-responsive.img-center.img-bordered}

The user can modify this value for all events by changing the duration using the dropdown list. Once changed, all events’ slots are recalculated.
