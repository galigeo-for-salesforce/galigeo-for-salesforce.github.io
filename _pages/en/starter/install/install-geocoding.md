# Package installation

The geocoding module is, like any typical Salesforce application, installed from a URL, which can be launched in the browser or directly from the [Salesforce AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N30000000q66zEAA).

For installation steps, refer to the [Salesforce documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.appExchangeInstallGuide.meta/appExchangeInstallGuide/appexchange_install_installation.htm).

## Checking the installed package

To verify that the installation has been successfully completed, go to **Setup > Installed Packages**.
