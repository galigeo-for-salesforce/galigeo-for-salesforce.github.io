## New cluster design

Clusters have been redesigned to discard any ambiguity around their meaning.

- The size reflects the number of markers a cluster is accounting for
- The contrast between gray and white make them perfectly visible on any basemap

## Displaying borders when searching for a geographical entity


When searching for a geographical entity (country, region, district...) borders appear. They let you visualize one area very fast.

This feature is great to combine with markers on analytic layers. You can clearly visualize what is in or out the zone you are interested in and carry on with your analysis.

- Borders are displayed when you search for a city, district, region...
