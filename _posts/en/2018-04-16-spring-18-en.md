### New mobile interface

We have reworked the mobile interface to highlight visit plans and sales tours, and make the planning view the entry point of the application.

### Analytics & Reporting

The data table allows you to create custom formulas such as the evolution of the revenue.

### Field Service Salesforce

We now support the Work Order object.

### Increased flexibility when creating events

Ability to change the classic behavior to create events by adding custom behaviors, specific to your needs. Examples: automatically fill in the description, generate templates of visit reports, etc. Contact us for implementation.

### Event creation support in Lightning

We improved support via pop-ups.

### Location of the user when opening the map

You can parameter the map to be centered either on the address of the user (sales rep, ...) registered in Salesforce, or on its geo-localized position.

### Name of the data layer

The label of the data layer takes the name of the object. For example, the label "Data" becomes "Accounts" for Accounts, "Suppliers" for Suppliers, etc.

### Filters display order

Your administrator can now organize the filters by name and not just by label.
