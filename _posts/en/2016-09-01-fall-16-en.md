## Analytics take on a new dimension

You can know provide end users with a lot more information on the same map! (in particular, thanks to visibility thresholds and newly available thematic analysis). On the Admin side, the ease of creating and making Analytics available also greatly improved.

Below, a video overview of what is now possible to achieve with Analytics in Galigeo for Salesforce:

In this example, you notice:

- [Visibily thresholds]() allowing the user to access different visualizations according to his zoom level
- [Labels]() used to display their zipcode

### New thematics

Unique symbols et lablels are now available when creating a new thematics.

### Manual range of colors

On top of automatic methods to determine ranges of values, you can now manually set thresholds of your choice.

For instance, to Par exemple, pour distinguer les zones géographiques pour lesquelles un indicateur est positif ou négatif, vous pouvez créer un seuil à 0 pour ensuite attribuer une couleur rouge aux valeurs négatives, verte aux valeurs positives.

### Visibility thresholds


With visibility thresholds, you can choose the zoom levels where your analytics is visible. 

The zoom levels span from World wide view to house number view.

In the example below, we created analytics displaying information at an area level (french departement). They are displayed for zooms with an high level. For lower zoom levels, Analytics display the same information at a zipcode level.

Also note that in the Analytics pannel hidden Analytics are grayed (not available at the current zoom level).

### Cloning data sources

Cloning data sources is a fantastic time saver for Admins. Once defined a data source and its analytics, the Admin can clone them and easily set up the same analysis for other geographic area or for other segments of the records he is working with.

Create everything from scratch again is no more required, phew!

In the documentation, you will find a [detailled example]() showing how to copy an analysis based on Accounts with a 'Client' Record Type to duplicate it to analyse Accounts with a 'Prospect' Record Type.

It is also possible to [clone an analysis]({{ site.url }}/analytics#cloner-une-analyse).

## Displaying points of interest

Points of interest allow to answer in an easy and flexible way numerous Sales teams' needs.

Let's assume a Sales Representative works on a map displaying Accounts. After a meeting with a customer, he wants to make the best out of his journey and visit nearby prospects. 

On the same map, he can display "prospects" originating from a different Salesforce object. It is possible to display the 200 propects who are closest from the customer he just left. The same way he does it for Accounts, he has access to prospects' labels and information panel.

## Choose where to display your objects' information more easily

### Selection table

First, selecting the fields you want to display in the application is more transparent and simple.

By ticking boxes in one single table you decide wether or not to display fields: in the information panel, in the labels and in the statistics. An info-bubble is there to give you a sense of where those 3 lists are used in the end user interface.

### Fields used for statistics

You might already have noticed it, it is now possible to choose the fields you want to use for statistics. It allows you to avoid things like showing average of percentages... Good news!
