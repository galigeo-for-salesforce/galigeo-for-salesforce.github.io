## Analytics take on a new dimension

End users can now have access to a lot more information on the same map! (in particular, thanks to visibility thresholds and newly available thematic analysis). On the Admin side, the ease of creating and making Analytics available also greatly improved.

Below, an overview of what is possible to achieve with Analytics in Galigeo for Salesforce:

In this example, you notice:

- [Visibily thresholds](#visibility-thresholds) allowing the user to access different visualizations according to the zoom level
- [A Label Thematic](#new-thematics) to display zipcode numbers

### New thematics

Unique symbols et labels are now available when creating a new thematic.

### Manual range of colors

On top of automatic methods to determine ranges of values, you can now manually set thresholds of your choice.

For instance, to set apart geographical areas where an indicator is positive from those where it is negative, you can: 

- Add a threshold at the value 0 
- Assign a red color to negative values
- Assign a green color to positive values

### Visibility thresholds

With visibility thresholds, you can choose the zoom levels where your analytics is visible. 

The zoom levels span from World wide view to house number view.

In the example below, we created analytics displaying information at an area level (french departement). Those analytics are displayed for higher zoom levels. For lower zoom levels, we display the same data at a zipcode level.

Also note that in the Analytics pannel Analytics hidden at current zoom level are grayed.

### Cloning data sources

Cloning data sources is a fantastic time saver for Admins. Once defined a data source and its analytics, the Admin can clone them and easily set up the same analysis for other geographic area or for other segments of the records he is working with.

Creating everything from scratch is history, phew!

In the documentation, you will find a [detailled example]({{site.url}}/analytics-en#clone-a-data-source) showing how to copy an analysis based on Accounts with a 'Client' Record Type, duplicate and modify it, to analyse Accounts with a 'Prospect' Record Type.

It is also possible to [clone an analytic]({{ site.url }}/analytics-en#clone-an-analytic).

## Displaying points of interest

Points of interest allow to answer numerous Sales teams' needs in an easy and flexible way.

Let's assume a Sales Representative works on a map displaying Accounts. After a meeting with a customer, he wants to make the best out of his journey and visit nearby prospects. 

On the same map, he can display "prospects" originating from a different Salesforce object. It is possible to display the closest 200 propects around the customer he just left. He has access labels and information panel for every prospect in order to access on the map information about them.

## Choose where to display your objects' information more easily

### Selection table

First, selecting the fields you want to display in the application is more simple.

By ticking boxes in one single table you decide wether to display or hide fields in the information panel, in the labels and in the statistics. An info-bubble is also there to give you a sense of where those 3 lists are used in the end user interface.

### Fields used for statistics

As stated above, it is now possible to choose the fields you want to use for statistics. It allows you to avoid showing average of percentages... Good news!
