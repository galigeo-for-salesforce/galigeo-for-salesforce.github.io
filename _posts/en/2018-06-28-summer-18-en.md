### Recurring events

After generating a route and adding events to the calendar, it is now possible to make them recurring on a weekly or monthly basis.

An icon also indicates recurring events in the calendar.

See the article [Visit planning and optimized routes](/plan-en) for more info.

### User help encouraging adoption

**Guided tour during the 1st connection**

Users who log in for the first time now see a wizard showing the main features of Galigeo in a few steps.
This contributes to a better understanding of the application and favours its adoption.

**Accessing online documentation from the application**

A new help icon opens the documentation site without from the application, in a window over the map.

**Contextual help**

Next to each tool title, an icon links to the corresponding help page.

### Filters and Analytics display

**Saving Analytics**

In the same way as the Filters, Analytics selected by the user are now saved (via cookies) when the map is closed.

**Exclusions management in Filters**

Admins can use the "NOT IN" operator when configuring Filters. To not, for example, show accounts without opportunities.
